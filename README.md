##  How It Works

### 1. **Imports Libraries**

```python
import pyautogui
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
```

* `pyautogui` ‚Äì used for screen capture
* `tkinter` ‚Äì used for GUI and file dialog

### 2. **Create GUI Window**

* A Tkinter window appears with a canvas (for potential enhancements)
* A button labeled **"Take Screenshot"** is displayed

### 3. **Define Screenshot Function**

```python
def take_screenshot():
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".png", filetypes=[("PNG files", "*.png")])
    if file_path:
        screenshot.save(file_path.replace('.png', '') + "_screenshot.png")
```

* Captures the screen
* Opens a file dialog to select save path and name
* Appends `_screenshot.png` to the saved file

### 4. **Run the Application**

* The program initializes the GUI loop and waits for the user to click the screenshot button.
